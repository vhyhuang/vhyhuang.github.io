          <p>
            I chose to enroll in a mechanical engineering program because I was interested in a career path that applied science to make people's lives better and that had a strong code of ethics. My engineering degree focuses on the mechatronics and energy and environment streams offered at my school. I also plan to complete a certificate in communication and a minor in sustainable energy. These paths refect my interests and what I believe are the skills I need to contribute to doing something worthwhile to change the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In university, in addition to engineering design, I have learned several specialized softwares, including MATLAB, Minitab, and Solidworks. I have also learned to code in Python since high school. In one year of studying the language, I was able to volunteer with Ladies Learning Code to teach youth my age about data analysis and importing data from .csv files. Finally, at my most recent internship with KPMG, I learned how to perform data and analytics work using Alteryx and Excel, and how to create visualizations with Power BI.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recognize the privilege I have in attending a top engineering school in Canada as a child of immigrants. I would like to show other people that what makes them different is exactly why their perspectives are valued in a field like engineering, where thinking differently leads to innovation and change.

        <h2>Kit Based CNC Mill</h2>
          <div id="photos">
            <div id="description">
              <p>
                In my second year mechanical engineering design course, I led a team of six students in designing a kit-based CNC mill.
              </p>
              <p>
                We focused on minimizing cost and complexity, since we recognized that our end user was likely a beginner that couldn't afford a more upscale CNC mill. However, we wanted to create something durable that had more than three axes of movement, so the user would have versatility when using our design, which was lacking in the market of kit CNC machines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our final deliverables included a 3D Solidworks model of our design, CAD drawings, and a final report that documented our design process and our other candidate designs. This project earned a final grade of 94%.

          <h2>Optimization of High Floor Vehicle Wheelchair Platform Lift Mechanism</h2>
          <div id=wheelchair>
            <div id=description>
              <p>
                For this project, the goal was to use MATLAB to analyze a given wheelchair lift mechanism and then optimize the lift according to two objectives. An optimized lift mechanism needed to occupy 10% less space than the original, and take 1 second less to deploy.
              </p>
              <p>
                I used vector loop analysis to create systems of equations to represent the linkages in the lift, and then used that to create a MATLAB model capable of benchmarking the original mechanism. I then used MATLAB to iterate through combinations of linkage lengths and found optimal lengths that would meet both objectives. The final report of my analysis earned 95%.

            <p>
              With a team of three other students, we are developing a robot to compete in the annual UTRA SUMO competition. In this competition, two robots are placed in a circle, and whichever robot knocks the other out of the arena wins the round.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was responsible for designing the frame for the robot in Solidworks and sourcing MDF material so we could laser cut the frame. I also helped to solder the circuit board for our robot and I coded an Arduino microcontroller for the robot to operate from.

              In the second half of my first year engineering design course, I was the project manager for developing the Thermoband. It is a headband that continuously monitors an infant's temperature from their temporal arteries. The goal was to develop an electronic means of measuring infant body temperature that was minimally invasive and accurate, for home use.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the project manager, I was responsible for managing the team workflow using a Gnatt chart, and I also developed a proof of concept model using a breadboard, a temperature sensor, an Arduino microcontroller, and a LCD screen to display outputs. I also soldered some of the components together.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the process of this project, we met with our client at the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering to determine what was her need for this project and to solicit feedback from her. We created several deliverables, including multiple reports capturing our research and design process, and a final presentation that was held with our colleagues and our client in attendance.

        <h2> Settings App for Users with Cataracts</h2>
        <div id="photos">
          <div id="description">
            <p>
              In the first half of my first year engineering design course, I led a team in developing a more accessible settings app for users with cataracts. By using Tanvas haptic technology to allow users to navigate the screen based on how the icons and sliders felt, they would be able to more easily adjust the settings on their device.
            </p>
            <p>
              To develop conceptual designs for this app, I researched the experience of people living with cataracts to develop the requirements for a viable design. I then used a weighted decision matrix to analyze the conceptual designs that the team created.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our final deliverable was a report with our final design that achieved a grade of 94%, and was used as an example for training TAs for the second half of this course.
            </p>
            <p>
              The picture on the right shows diagrams I drew to showcase the design we created, called "Location Independent Gestures" (LIG). These gestures would allow the user to feel texture as they turned up/down brightness and turned on/off high contrast text (HCT).

              In my first year at university, I completed a basic machining course at George Brown College. During the course, I used a lathe, mill, and drill press to mill a pneumatic piston.

        <h2>Solidworks Modelling Dissections</h2>
          <p>
            To learn Solidworks, my mechanical engineering design course had students complete five dissections to take apart devices and either model them or redesign them. In our final dissection, my team attempted to create a gearbox that was be 3D printed and tested based on assigned specifications for speed and torque.
