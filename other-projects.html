           The area of project management is interesting to me because it ensures that objectives are accomplished on time, suppliers have a fair change to compete for contracts and are paid on time, and team members are satisfied with the project leadership and project goals are communicated effectively to them.
           Additionally, I feel that business and communication skills are important to me because if you have an idea but cannot pitch it, you won't be able to develop it. My graphic design sense and past experience with creating business pitches is an asset that I bring to any project, whether it's in the engineering industry or not.

            I have worked as a consultant for KPMG in 2022 and conducted a review of the City of Richmond Hill's project management practices. As a result, I learned much about good practices of project management and seen examples for areas of improvement when managing major capital projects.
            At KPMG during my 2021 summer internship, I pitched a startup idea with my team that won the GTA Founder's School Challenge. <!--I also contributed written material and graphics to the KPMG GTA interns' award winning yearbook.--> Also, in my first year of university, I created posters for Chestnut Residence events that I would organize monthly as a floor social coordinator.

            As a consultant of the Major Project Advisory team during my 2022 summer internship at KPMG Canada, I wrote a portion of the final report of the team's review of the City of Richmond Hill's project management practices. I assessed the good practices and opportunities for improvement in the areas of cost and financial management, and information management. The final report was presented to the City's Executive Leadership and made available on their website. A copy of this report is also embeded here.

                    Doodlebug is a startup focused on transitioning the aquaculture industry to more sustainable feed made from dried black soldier fly larvae (BSFL).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make traditional feed, small fish are caught by wide net trawling which damages the ocean floor and risks overfishing. BSFL are almost 50% protein by weight and one female lays 500 eggs, therefore, growing them as feed is extremely cost efficient. Additionally, to feed the BSFL, we will take food waste from farmers, supermakets, and food wholesalers, which in turn promotes a more sustainable food chain in Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By competing on sustainability, price, and customer satisfaction, Doodlebug has the potential to change the way Canadians grow their food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I was responsible for branding, logo design, and promotional materials, as well as product research and market analysis. Our final deliverable was a live pitch that won the Founders' School Challenge out of 11 teams.

            <p>
              While completing my internship at KPMG, I worked on the GTA Summer Interns' yearbook. Every year, each geography of KPMG Canada has their summer interns create a yearbook of their internship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our yearbook won the nation wide KPMG summer internship yearbook competition. It was a unique experience to document an entirely virtual internship with no in-person events. I am thankful for being able to contribute a section on women in the workplace and collages for the pet show and tell and "one word to describe us" sections.

        <h2>Chestnut Residence Event Posters</h2>
          <p>
            At Chestnut Residence, I was voted to be the floor social coordinator of floors 26 and 27. Alongside my floor president and don, we managed a budget of approximately $800 to fund events for the school year, and committed to hosting several events per month.
          </p>
          <p>
            These ranged from an interactive video game playthrough of Life Is Strange, skating at the Bentway, and a food trip to Nugateau. Ultimately, my goal was to connect the floor and give people the opportunity to meet each other at my events.
